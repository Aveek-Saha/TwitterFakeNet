# Twitter Fake News Network
An exploration of Twitter's Verified users and the news articles they tweet. Specifially looking into how likely is it that an article shared by the user is fake.

## Background
### What is a verified user?
Every user that is verified is given a blue badge and this lets people know that an account of public interest is authentic.

According to Twitter-
> An account may be verified if it is determined to be an account of public interest. Typically this includes accounts maintained by users in music, acting, fashion, government, politics, religion, journalism, media, sports, business, and other key interest areas. A verified badge does not imply an endorsement by Twitter.

So accounts are generally verified if they belong to public figures, like politicians, comedians, businessmen, etc or organizations like news networks, sports teams, corporations and so on.


### Why verified users?
Due to the social significance of verified users they're crutial in the dissemination and propogation of information and it's worthwhile exploring how reliable or trustworthy these users are as news sources.
The verified status does not make the account any more credible than it was before verification and from this recent paper- [Does Being Verified Make You More Credible? Account Verificationâ€™s Effect on Tweet Credibility](https://security.cs.georgetown.edu/~tavish/twitter-credibility-chi2019.pdf) we can see that most users understand this.
